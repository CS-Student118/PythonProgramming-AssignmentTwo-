# PythonProgramming-AssignmentTwo-
This is the second program I wrote for my Python programming course.

This program generates prompts the user to enter their first name, last name and student ID from theri
if takes the first three letters of the first name (or if it is less than three letters long than it uses the full
first name, then it takes the first three letters of the last name (if the last name is shorter than three letters it uses all
of the last name, and it takes the last three characters of the student ID (if it is shorther than 3 letters then if uses all of the ID)
and concatenates them together to generate a user name. It then prompts the user to enter a password and ensures the password meets the criteria.
The criteria for the password is that it must have a lowercase letter, an uppercase letter and a number.
